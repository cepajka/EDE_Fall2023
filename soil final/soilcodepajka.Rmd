## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r split elevations}
low_elev <- soil_complete2002 %>%
  filter(ELEVATION < 800)

mid_elev <- filter(soil_complete2002, ELEVATION %in% 800:1199)

high_elev <- filter(soil_complete2002, ELEVATION >= 1200)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
